**PLANS**
- I know learning stuff like JS and Python will get me very far, as such it is a priority for myself to learn these as soon as possible.
- Learning some web development. I find this stuff very interesting and would like to learn more just for the heck of it.
- Honestly just getting to know more about the computer, a good goal right now for me is to make my own operating system at some point, seems daunting but I think I got it.
- *Scholarly Plans Below*
- Graduate highschool (this one should hopefully be quite easy) Class of 2025.
- Graduate college/university with a BS and MS in computer science. Will probably acquire my BS in 2025 or 2026 and will get my MS either 2026 or 2027.
