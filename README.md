**PLANS**
- I know learning stuff like JS and Python will get me very far, as such it is a priority for myself to learn these as soon as possible.
- Learning some web development. I find this stuff very interesting and would like to learn more just for the heck of it.
- Honestly just getting to know more about the computer, a good goal right now for me is to make my own operating system at some point, seems daunting but I think I got it.

- Graduate highschool (this one should hopefully be quite easy) Class of 2025.

"Make this an actual website
 instead of a .md file like 
 it is right now."
```

- **My daily work operating system is EndeavorOS just an an Arch based distribution along with hyprland, a wayland compositor that doesn't sacrifice on its looks.**
