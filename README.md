**PLANS**
- I know learning stuff like JS and Python will get me very far, as such it is a priority for myself to learn these as soon as possible.
- Learning some web development. I find this stuff very interesting and would like to learn more just for the heck of it.
- Honestly just getting to know more about the computer, a good goal right now for me is to make my own operating system at some point, seems daunting but I think I got it.
